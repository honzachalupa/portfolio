    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the Workout Heatmap app ("the App") handles information. The
      App visualizes your Apple Health workouts to display activity summaries and map routes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Workout Heatmap accesses Apple Health data that you explicitly permit, including workout
      metadata, distance, active energy, route coordinates, heart rate summaries, and related
      metrics. This information is only used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Render workout routes and heatmaps on the map</li>
      <li>Populate workout detail views with statistics and trends</li>
      <li>Maintain a local history of previously loaded workouts for faster loading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App does not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or personal information beyond
      the HealthKit data you authorize.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Workout information is read directly from HealthKit and cached locally on your device for
        offline access.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cached workouts remain on device storage and are never transmitted to the developer or
        external services.
      </li>
      <li>Removing the App or revoking Health permissions clears access to the cached data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App relies on the following Apple services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HealthKit: to access your workouts and associated metrics.</li>
      <li>MapKit: to display your workout routes on maps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These services operate under Apple's privacy policies. No other third-party SDKs are used.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Rights and Control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can grant or revoke Health permissions at any time in the Apple Health app.</li>
      <li>
        You may delete workouts directly in Health, which removes them from Workout Heatmap on the
        next refresh.
      </li>
      <li>You can clear cached workouts by removing and reinstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All processing occurs on your device. Standard iOS safeguards (such as device encryption and
      Face ID / Touch ID) protect access to the App and its local cache.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Workout Heatmap is intended for users aged 13 and older. The App does not knowingly collect
      information about children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Updates to this Privacy Policy will be reflected by revising the "Last Updated" date below.
      Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
