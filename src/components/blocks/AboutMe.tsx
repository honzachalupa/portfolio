                    Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that
                    live on the internet. My interest in web development started
                    back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr
                    themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button
                    taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
                </p>

                <p className="pb-5 text-lg">
                    Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the privilege of
                    working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge
                    corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus
                    these days is building accessible, inclusive products and
                    digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

                    I also recently launched a course that covers everything you
                    need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node &
                    React.

                    Here are a few technologies I&apos;ve been working with
                    recently:
